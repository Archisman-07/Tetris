Origin of Tetris :

About the game Tetris :
The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.

About the Project :
The project aims to develop Tetris using Python.The various modules used in this project are Pygame and Random.The use of matrices has been made to specify the corners of the falling blocks/shapes and to determine their orientation.
